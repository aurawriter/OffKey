A commonly known Misenian folk story is that a Wailord was once beached on the island many centuries ago and died. That wailord supposedly became the jungle as it stands today, and is still trying to stay alive by absorbing whatever nutrients it can. Only Ghost Pokemon are capable of inhabiting this area.",
