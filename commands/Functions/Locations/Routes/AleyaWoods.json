	"locationName": "Aleya Woods",
	"locationDescription": "Not much remains of Aleya Woods after the devastating fire that destroyed it and Relwick Town five years ago. The area was once a popular location for Pokemon battles, lending plausibility to the well-known theory that a fight involving a Fire-type Pokemon was the cause behind the blaze. The presence of Fire- and Ghost-type Pokemon now inhabiting the area are presumed to be the reason the forest has been unable to regrow. It stands just as it did when it died, solemn and lifeless.",
